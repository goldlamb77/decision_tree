# predicting loan approval using decision trees and random forest

This project uses decision trees and random forest on the [SMS Spam Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) training dataset using Python and libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit, matplotlib, and seaborn

## Objective

To use the dataset given to create a decision tree and a random forest to predict if ones loan can be approved

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle
- Format: CSV
- Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
  
## Key Features
- decision tree
- random forest
- accuracy score

## Skills practiced

- Real world dataset handling
- visualization with seaborn/matplotlib
- Data Wrangling with pandas
- performing a decision tree and random forest using scikitlearn
- printing out a decision tree
- calculating the accuracy score for decision trees and random forest

## How to Run

1. Open the juypter note book or run in google collab
2. All cells are able to be executed as is
3. go in to the kaggle link that is given and download train.csv and added it to juypter notebook or google collab
4. run the code
